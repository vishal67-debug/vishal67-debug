# Unlocking the Future: 
## Exploring the Boundless Possibilities of LIFI Technology
## Introduction
###### In the age of a crowded world, Li-Fi is the new wireless way communication that uses LEDs to transmit information wirelessly. secure network Radio waves make up only a small part of the existing electromagnetic spectrum traditional wireless communication methods based on radio waves. The basis of this technology is that by changing the light, data can be transmitted through the LED light Gigahertz radio waves for data transmission. TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Global Conversation on Visible Light Communication (VLC) Simply put, Li-Fi can be thought of as light-based Wi-Fi, which means it uses light instead of radio waves. With the unused visible light bandwidth currently available for radio waves for data transmission, LiFi can play an important role in lightening heavy loads on current wireless systems. RF communications, which is around 300 GHz. Also, since Li-Fi uses the visible spectrum, it is By communicating with visible light, Li-Fi technology can change the habit we use the internet, stream videos, receive emails and more.

## *How does the LiFI work?* 
###### LiFi technology will allow us to connect to the internet using light from lamps, streetlights or LED televisions. In addition to being cheaper, safer and faster than Wi-Fi, it does not need a router. All you need to do is point your mobile or tablet towards a light bulb to surf the web.

___
## *What is LIFI technology?*
##### **LiFi (light fidelity) is a bidirectional wireless system that transmits data via LED or infrared light.**It was first unveiled in 2011 and, unlike wifi, which uses radio frequency, LiFi technology only needs a light source with a chip to transmit an internet signal through light waves.This is an extraordinary advance over today's wireless networks. **LiFi multiplies the speed and bandwidth of wifi, 3G and 4G.**The latter have a limited capacity and become saturated when the number of users surfing increases, causing them to crash, reducing speeds and even interrupting the connection. With LiFi, however, its band frequency of 200,000 GHz, versus the maximum 5 GHz of the wifi, is 100 times faster and can transmit much more information per second. A 2017 study by the University of Eindhoven obtained a **download rate of 42.8 Gbit/s with infrared light with a radius of 2.5 metres**, when the best wifi would barely reach 300 Mbit/s.

## *ROLLING OUT LIFI WORLDWIDE* 
##### LiFi technology emerged thanks to the German physicist Harald Haas, a professor and director of the LiFi Research and Development Centre at the University of Edinburgh, and it could reach our homes in just a few years. It is currently being tested with LED luminaires in offices around the world and the **aeronautical industry is already working on solutions to integrate it into commercial aircraft.** 
##### Airports, hospitals and city streets are other spaces where LiFi technology could become popular. The boom in mobile devices and the growing demand for higher bandwidth systems are expected to drive the development of this social technology in the next decade, as noted in the Global Market for LiFi Technology Analysis and Forecast 2018-2028.
###### This report estimates that **the global market will reach a value of nearly $36 billion in 2028**, and that over the next 10 years the compound annual growth rate will rise to 71.2%. The Asia-Pacific region will lead the global growth in LiFi technology up to 2028, overtaking Europe, which remained at the forefront in 2017.

## *Application Of Li Fi Technology*
### 1) *Urban environment* 
##### Dense urban areas are hugely dependent on artificial lighting for their illumination needs.Using Li Fi in such areas can provide easy access to high-speed internet to people as they move in the environment. For instance, hotel authorities can install Li Fi along the corridors, reception areas, and rooms in order to make high data rate downloads available to the guests. 
###### Moreover, since light waves do not propagate through the walls, guests and employees can get access to interference-free wireless communication. 
### 2) *Museums and galleries* 
##### Museums or art galleries typically exhibit artefacts, paintings, sculptures, etc. which are illuminated with accent lighting. Interestingly, concerned authorities can decide on Li Fi technology to enhance the experience of their visitors. 
##### The top commercial lighting manufacturers assert that Li Fi enabled lighting can provide localized information within the light.  This will allow the visitors to download and view more information about the exhibit on their communication devices using the light used for illumination. 
 ### 3)*Smart office* 
##### The concept of smart office or modern workspace acknowledges technology integration and security significantly. Thus, Li Fi automatically becomes a favourable choice. Since light cannot travel through the walls, Li Fi signals can be secured within a physical space that helps in the formulation of a technologically-advanced and secure environment. 

### 4) *Li-Fi and Augmented Reality (AR)* 
##### Augmented Reality (AR) is the process of overlaying and aligning computer-generated content over a view of the physical world. By using a transparent OpenGL layer over the render surface of a camera, we can display virtual information over Reality

## *Challenges and Limitation of Li Fi technology*

### *Limited Range* 
##### The fact that light can’t penetrate through walls might be a good thing when it comes to security but this also means that LiFi has a very limited range. That means you can only use it effectively in closed spaces. In establishments, lights must be tactically placed in rooms, and halls to expand the scope of the LiFi network. In open spaces, Wi-Fi’s coverage can go up to 32 meters but LiFi can only go up to 10 meters. 
___
### *Limited Compatibility* 
##### Since LiFi is a new technology, not many devices are compatible with it. Most devices that we use now still use hardware for Wi-Fi networking and it’s unlikely that we will see LiFi enabled personal devices in the next couple of years.Not the answer to slow internet speeds LiFi does have a faster data transfer rate but if the Internet speed from service providers are still slow, the best aspect of this technology remains insignificant. In countries that have slower internet speeds, deploying a LiFi network would be meaningless. It will take coordination from various industries to encourage mass implementation of this technology. n our ever-evolving world, cities are embracing the concept of smart city development to improve efficiency, sustainability, and the quality of life for residents.

## Conclusion
##### The possibilities are numerous and can be explored further. If this technology can be put into practical use, every bulb can be used something like a wi-fi hotspot to transmit wireless data and can be proceed towards the cleaner, greener, safer, brighter future. The concept of li-fi is currently attracting a great of interest, not least because it may offer a genuine and very efficient alternative to radio-based wireless. As a growing number of people and their many devices access wireless in internet, the airwaves are becoming increasingly clogged, making it more and more difficult to get a reliable , high-speed signal. This may solve issues such as the shortage of radio-frequency bandwidth and also allow internet where traditional radio based wireless isn’t allowed such as aircraft or hospitals. One of the shortcomings however is that it only work in direct line of sight
